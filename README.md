# Web3 Fraud Detection Engine

A professional Web3 reference project that demonstrates how blockchain fraud monitoring systems can be modeled using clean and modular Web3 architecture.

This repository focuses on simulating transaction streams, detecting abnormal wallet behavior, scoring risk levels, and generating fraud analytics in a beginner-friendly and production-style format.
